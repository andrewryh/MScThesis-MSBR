I would like to express to my sincere gratitude towards my advisor Professor Kathryn Huff
for her valuable support throughout this project. She offered perpetual encouragement, patience and guidance
without which I would not have been able to complete this thesis. I would also like to thank Professor Tomasz Kozlowski and Professor Rizwan Uddin for their assessment and regarded perspectives in the review of this work. This work is also part of the "Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles" Petascale Computational Resource allocation support by the National Science Foundation.

I would also like to thank my colleagues Jin Whan Bae, Alex Lindsay, Gavin Ridley, Gyu Tae Park, Sun Myung Park, and Anshuman Chaube for their thoughts, discussion and help during research and writing of this work. I would like to recognize all the faculty and staff of the Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering department who have continuously aided and guided me since my very first day in Champaign. 

Finally, I thank my wife Nelli Alivoryan and my daughters Sofiya and Zoe Annabelle for their limitless love and support. I have wholehearted thankfulness for my mother and my sisters who have always encouraged me in all my beginnings and without whom this work would not have been possible.

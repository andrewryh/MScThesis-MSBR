	abstract = {Molten salt reactors have seen a marked resurgence of interest over the past decade, highlighted by their inclusion as one of six Generation {IV} reactor types. The most active development period however was between the mid 1950s and early 1970s at Oak Ridge National Laboratories ({ORNL}) and any new re-examination of this concept must bear in mind the far different priorities then in place. High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR}) program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where {ORNL} left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, {MSBR} design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that {ORNL} proposed for the majority of its {MSR} program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile 233UF4 and fertile {ThF}4. Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the “plumbing problem”. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by {ORNL} was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than {LWR} or {CANDU} without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor ({MSR}), as one of the Generation {IV} advanced nuclear systems, has attracted a worldwide interest due to its excellent performances in safety, economics, sustainability, and proliferation resistance. The aim of this work is to provide and evaluate possible solutions to fissile 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and further the fuel transition to thorium fuel cycle in a thermal {MSR} by using plutonium partitioned from light water reactors spent fuel. By using an in-house developed tool, a breeding and burning (B\&B) scenario is first introduced and analyzed from the aspects of the evolution of main nuclides, net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production, spectrum shift, and temperature feedback coefficient. It can be concluded that such a Th/Pu to Th/233UTh/233U{\textbackslash}hbox \{Th\}/{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} transition can be accomplished by employing a relatively fast fuel reprocessing with a cycle time less than 60 days. At the equilibrium state, the reactor can achieve a conversion ratio of about 0.996 for the 60-day reprocessing period ({RP}) case and about 1.047 for the 10-day {RP} case. The results also show that it is difficult to accomplish such a fuel transition with limited reprocessing ({RP} is 180 days), and the reactor operates as a converter and burns the plutonium with the help of thorium. Meanwhile, a pre-breeding and burning ({PB}\&B) scenario is also analyzed briefly with respect to the net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and evolution of main nuclides. One can find that it is more efficient to produce 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} under this scenario, resulting in a double time varying from about 1.96 years for the 10-day {RP} case to about 6.15 years for the 180-day {RP} case.},

Many countries worldwide contribute to this reactor technology, among which the European Union, France, Japan, Russia and the {USA}, and for the past few years China and India have also contributed. In general, the international R\&D focuses on three main lines of research. The {USA} focuses on the {FHR}, which will be a nearer-term application of liquid salt as a reactor coolant, while China also focuses on solid fuel reactors as a precursor to molten salt reactors with liquid fuel and a thermal neutron spectrum. The {EU}, France and Russia are focusing on the development of a fast spectrum molten salt reactor capable of either breeding or transmutation of actinides from spent nuclear fuel. Future research topics focus on liquid salt technology and materials behavior, the fuel and fuel cycle chemistry and modeling, and the numerical simulation and safety design aspects of the reactor. {MSR} development attracts more and more attention every year, because it is generally considered as most sustainable of the six Generation-{IV} designs with intrinsic safety features.

This paper provides an initial description and technical analysis of its key features. The proposed {AHTR} uses coated-particle graphite-matrix fuel similar to that used in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors ({HTGRs}), such as the General Atomics gas turbine-modular helium reactor. However, unlike the {HTGRs}, the {AHTR} uses a molten-salt coolant and a pool configuration, similar to that of the General Electric Super Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module (S-{PRISM}) liquid-metal reactor. Because the boiling points for molten fluoride salts are near 1400°C, the reactor can operate at very high temperatures and atmospheric pressure. For thermochemical H2 production, the heat is delivered at the required near-constant high temperature and low pressure. For electricity production, a multireheat helium Brayton (gas-turbine) cycle, with efficiencies {\textgreater}50\%, is used. The low-pressure molten-salt coolant, with its high heat capacity and natural circulation heat transfer capability, creates the potential for robust safety (including fully passive decay-heat removal) and improved economics with passive safety systems that allow higher power densities and scaling to large reactor sizes [{\textgreater}1000 {MW}(electric)].},

This convention, widely adopted in life cycle assessment ({LCA}) studies of bioenergy systems, underestimates the climate impact of bioenergy. Besides {CO}2 emissions from permanent C losses, {CO}2 emissions from C flux neutral systems (that is from temporary C losses) also contribute to climate change: before being captured by biomass regrowth, {CO}2 molecules spend time in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. In this paper, a method to estimate the climate impact of {CO}2 emissions from biomass combustion is proposed. Our method uses {CO}2 impulse response functions ({IRF}) from C cycle models in the elaboration of atmospheric decay functions for biomass-derived {CO}2 emissions. Their contributions to global warming are then quantified with a unit-based index, the {GWPbio}. Since this index is expressed as a function of the rotation period of the biomass, our results can be applied to {CO}2 emissions from combustion of all the different biomass species, from annual row crops to slower growing boreal forest.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors ({MSRs}) have a long history with the first design studies beginning in the 1950s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ({ORNL}). Traditionally these reactors are thought of as thermal breeder reactors running on the thorium to 233U cycle and the historical competitor to fast breeder reactors. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in molten salt reactors, which have been considered in the framework of the Generation {IV} International Forum, because of their several potentialities and favorable features when compared with conventional solid-fueled reactors. {MSRs} meet many of the future goals of nuclear energy, in particular for what concerns an improved sustainability, an inherent safety with strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, stable coolant, low pressure operation that don not require expensive containment, easy to control, passive decay heat cooling and unique characteristics in terms of actinide burning and waste reduction, while benefiting from the past experience acquired with the molten salt technology. As the only liquid-fueled reactor concept, the safety basis, characteristics and licensing of an {MSR} are different from solid-uranium fueled light water reactors. In this paper, a historical review of the major plant systems in {MSR} is presented. The features of different safety characteristics of {MSR} power plant are reviewed and assessment in comparison to other solid fueled light water reactors {LWRs}.},

	abstract = {Molten-salt breeder reactors ({MSBR}’s) are being developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for generating low-cost power while extending the nation’s resources of fissionable fuel. The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of {UF}4 and {ThF}4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-{MW}(th) {MoltenSalt} Reactor Experiment ({MSRE}), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the {MSRE} fuel has demonstrated the {MSR} processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit {MSR}’s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give {MSR} converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an {MSBR} power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/{kWh} less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},

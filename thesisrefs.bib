	abstract = {Molten salt reactors have seen a marked resurgence of interest over the past decade, highlighted by their inclusion as one of six Generation IV reactor types. The most active development period however was between the mid 1950s and early 1970s at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) and any new re-examination of this concept must bear in mind the far different priorities then in place. High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where ORNL left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, MSBR design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that ORNL proposed for the majority of its MSR program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile 233UF4 and fertile ThF4. Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the “plumbing problem”. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by ORNL was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than LWR or CANDU without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

A toy 300MW(th) reactor with a FLiBe carrier salt is employed to demonstrate the performance of the method over 10 full power years. Results of the calculation are presented, including material flows, conversion ratio, effective delayed neutron fraction, and expected limits on trifluoride concentrations and graphite lifetime are investigated.

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor (MSR), as one of the Generation IV advanced nuclear systems, has attracted a worldwide interest due to its excellent performances in safety, economics, sustainability, and proliferation resistance. The aim of this work is to provide and evaluate possible solutions to fissile 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and further the fuel transition to thorium fuel cycle in a thermal MSR by using plutonium partitioned from light water reactors spent fuel. By using an in-house developed tool, a breeding and burning (B\&B) scenario is first introduced and analyzed from the aspects of the evolution of main nuclides, net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production, spectrum shift, and temperature feedback coefficient. It can be concluded that such a Th/Pu to Th/233UTh/233U{\textbackslash}hbox \{Th\}/{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} transition can be accomplished by employing a relatively fast fuel reprocessing with a cycle time less than 60 days. At the equilibrium state, the reactor can achieve a conversion ratio of about 0.996 for the 60-day reprocessing period (RP) case and about 1.047 for the 10-day RP case. The results also show that it is difficult to accomplish such a fuel transition with limited reprocessing (RP is 180 days), and the reactor operates as a converter and burns the plutonium with the help of thorium. Meanwhile, a pre-breeding and burning (PB\&B) scenario is also analyzed briefly with respect to the net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and evolution of main nuclides. One can find that it is more efficient to produce 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} under this scenario, resulting in a double time varying from about 1.96 years for the 10-day RP case to about 6.15 years for the 180-day RP case.},

	abstract = {The molten-salt-cooled Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) is a new reactor concept designed to provide very high-temperature (750 to 1000°C) heat to enable efficient low-cost thermochemical production of hydrogen (H2) or production of electricity. This paper provides an initial description and technical analysis of its key features. The proposed AHTR uses coated-particle graphite-matrix fuel similar to that used in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), such as the General Atomics gas turbine-modular helium reactor. However, unlike the HTGRs, the AHTR uses a molten-salt coolant and a pool configuration, similar to that of the General Electric Super Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module (S-PRISM) liquid-metal reactor. Because the boiling points for molten fluoride salts are near 1400°C, the reactor can operate at very high temperatures and atmospheric pressure. For thermochemical H2 production, the heat is delivered at the required near-constant high temperature and low pressure. For electricity production, a multireheat helium Brayton (gas-turbine) cycle, with efficiencies {\textgreater}50\%, is used. The low-pressure molten-salt coolant, with its high heat capacity and natural circulation heat transfer capability, creates the potential for robust safety (including fully passive decay-heat removal) and improved economics with passive safety systems that allow higher power densities and scaling to large reactor sizes [{\textgreater}1000 MW(electric)].},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from biomass combustion are traditionally assumed climate neutral if the bioenergy system is carbon (C) flux neutral, i.e. the CO2 released from biofuel combustion approximately equals the amount of CO2 sequestered in biomass. This convention, widely adopted in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of bioenergy systems, underestimates the climate impact of bioenergy. Besides CO2 emissions from permanent C losses, CO2 emissions from C flux neutral systems (that is from temporary C losses) also contribute to climate change: before being captured by biomass regrowth, CO2 molecules spend time in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. In this paper, a method to estimate the climate impact of CO2 emissions from biomass combustion is proposed. Our method uses CO2 impulse response functions (IRF) from C cycle models in the elaboration of atmospheric decay functions for biomass-derived CO2 emissions. Their contributions to global warming are then quantified with a unit-based index, the GWPbio. Since this index is expressed as a function of the rotation period of the biomass, our results can be applied to CO2 emissions from combustion of all the different biomass species, from annual row crops to slower growing boreal forest.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) have a long history with the first design studies beginning in the 1950s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Traditionally these reactors are thought of as thermal breeder reactors running on the thorium to 233U cycle and the historical competitor to fast breeder reactors. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in molten salt reactors, which have been considered in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum, because of their several potentialities and favorable features when compared with conventional solid-fueled reactors. MSRs meet many of the future goals of nuclear energy, in particular for what concerns an improved sustainability, an inherent safety with strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, stable coolant, low pressure operation that don not require expensive containment, easy to control, passive decay heat cooling and unique characteristics in terms of actinide burning and waste reduction, while benefiting from the past experience acquired with the molten salt technology. As the only liquid-fueled reactor concept, the safety basis, characteristics and licensing of an MSR are different from solid-uranium fueled light water reactors. In this paper, a historical review of the major plant systems in MSR is presented. The features of different safety characteristics of MSR power plant are reviewed and assessment in comparison to other solid fueled light water reactors LWRs.},

	abstract = {Molten-salt breeder reactors (MSBR’s) are being developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory for generating low-cost power while extending the nation’s resources of fissionable fuel. The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of UF4 and ThF4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-MW(th) MoltenSalt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the MSRE fuel has demonstrated the MSR processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit MSR’s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give MSR converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an MSBR power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/kWh less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},
